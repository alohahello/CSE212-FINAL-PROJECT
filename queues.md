INTRODCUTION TO QUEUES IN DATA STRUCTURE 

A queue is a list that can be represented as a real-world line, where the first element in line is the first element to be removed. To comprehend the queue data structure, we need to understand that it is a linear structure, meaning it follows a concept called 'First In, First Out' (FIFO). This implies that the first data or item that goes in is the first data that comes out.

In programming, adding an item to the queue is called "enqueue," and removing one is "dequeue."

To gain a better understanding of this topic lets learn some basic concepts:

* Enqueue: Add an element to the end of the queue
* Dequeue: Remove an element from the front of the queue
* IsEmpty: Check if the queue is empty
* IsFull: Check if the queue is full
* Peek: Get the value of the front of the queue without removing it

Queue operations work with two pointers: one at the FRONT (FI) and one at the REAR (FO).

* Queues process each element based on the order it is received.
* Queues are commonly used in task scheduling systems, such as in operating systems.

Lets have some examples to better understand this concepts:
